# Token Crowd Sale using Solidity
### Using solidty to create a smart contract for a crowdsale of an Ethereum token, "Kasei Token"
---
## Objective 
In this module, I created a " blockchain token". A "blockchain token" is digital record on a blockchain network that is a representation of an asset. That asset can have the form of a traditional asset, service, or currency. 

My objective in this module was to create a token called "KaseiCoin" and then deploy smart contracts that will be used for investors to buy the token using cryptocurrency. 

## Technologies 

The following technologies were leveraged for this assignment. Remix is an online editor for **Solidity**. This allows any user to create a smart contract within a blockchain. 
**Ganache** is used to supply test wallets with sample balances in order to evaluate the functionality of the blockchain and smart contract.
**MetaMask** is a cryto wall that allows to easily use block chain apps. By using metamask, I was able to simulate buyer's transactions of my tokens. Links to these tehcnologies to learn more are listed below
